<h1>Broomstick</h1>
<p> Daniel asked me to emote less because it reminded him of a dog

People were doing this new drug

Then I’m on a farm and/or in the game
And there’s a building that is more showy in its architecture very showy with a kind of loud green idea wrapped in, architect said he was inspired by a video or a game that he saw- I knew he just kinda ripped it off 1:1

Then this white woo couple move in to the farm/arena. There car was giant and had something strange about it, in like a Bosch biblical way.

They were also sort of buttoned up scientist types- some kind of in-between of the leftovers machine scientists and Ken Kesey, they were iv dripping the drug people were taking earlier. I said I wanted to do it and the power went out and we spent a lot of time with them. Getting to know them, they had very woo new names. 

The power was still out and they were lamenting how nice it was and then it was my turn. I remember remarking how funny the shift from my new friends I was vibing with to scientist was. Very stark seriousness around this experience. 


I the remember sort of browsing my laptop and watching this video.

The video was very ecology Rube Goldberg machine. Like a snake would eat a fruit then a bird will kill the snake and get an egg trapped in its beak on and on

Then I woke up, and the woo scientists were like “how was it?” And I totally remembered everything, and the video and computer I was watching all were just this kind of drug induced vision. 

I was only allowed to ask 4 questions to the scientist and I ask two and said I want to think about the next two carefully, and then I woke up </p>
